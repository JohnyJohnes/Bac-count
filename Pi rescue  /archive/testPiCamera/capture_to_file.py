# Sometimes, particularly in scripts which will perform some sort of 
# analysis or processing on images, you may wish to capture smaller images 
# than the current resolution of the camera. Although such resizing can be 
# performed using libraries like PIL or OpenCV, it is considerably more 
# efficient to have the Piâ€™s GPU perform the resizing when capturing the image.
# This can be done with the resize parameter of the capture() methods:
# camera.capture('my_image_resized.jpg', resize=(320, 240))
camera.capture_sequence(['image%02d.jpg' % i for i in range(10)],resize=(640,480))

# Explicitly close
